        "question_type": "brief_answer",
        "allotted_marks": 10,
        "model_answer": "Photosynthesis is a process in which green plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, primarily in leaves. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in leaves, absorbs light energy, which is used to split water molecules and form ATP and NADPH. Carbon dioxide is then fixed in the Calvin cycle to produce glucose.",
        "student_answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make food using sunlight. It also helps in producing oxygen."

        "question_type": "brief_answer",
        "allotted_marks": 10,
        "model_answer": "Newton's first law states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. The second law states that force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma). The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. For example, a book on a table remains at rest unless moved, a car accelerates based on engine force, and a rocket moves forward due to gas expulsion in the opposite direction.",
        "student_answer": "Newton gave three laws of motion. The first law is about rest and motion. The second law is about force and acceleration. The third law is about action and reaction."

        "model_answer": "Artificial intelligence (AI) improves efficiency, reduces human errors, and can handle large amounts of data quickly. AI is used in healthcare, finance, and automation. However, AI also has disadvantages, such as job displacement, ethical concerns, and biases in decision-making. AI systems require large datasets and computational power, and their decision-making can sometimes be unpredictable.",
        "student_answer": "AI is good because it helps in many fields like medicine and robots. But sometimes it can cause problems."

        "allotted_marks": 10,
        "model_answer": "The water cycle includes evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, and rivers, rises into the atmosphere, condenses into clouds, and falls as precipitation in the form of rain or snow. The water then returns to bodies of water or infiltrates into the ground.",
        "student_answer": "The water cycle has many steps. Water from lakes and oceans turns into gas. Then it forms clouds and falls as rain or snow."

        "model_answer": "The greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. This leads to global warming, causing rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather patterns. Human activities like burning fossil fuels increase greenhouse gases, worsening climate change.",
        "student_answer": "Greenhouse gases make the Earth hotter. This causes ice to melt and the weather to change."
