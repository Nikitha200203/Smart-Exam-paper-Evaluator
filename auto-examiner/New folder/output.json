        "student_answer": "Photosynthesis is when plants use sunlight to make food. They take in carbon dioxide and water, and with the help of sunlight, turn them into glucose and oxygen. This happens in the chloroplasts of plant cells. There are two parts: the light-dependent part and the Calvin cycle. In the first part, light is absorbed by chlorophyll and it splits water into oxygen. In the second part, plants use the energy to make glucose from carbon dioxide.",
        "model_answer": "Photosynthesis is a biochemical process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. It occurs mainly in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where chlorophyll absorbs light energy, typically from the sun. The process consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll, which splits water molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons, generating ATP and NADPH. In the Calvin cycle, ATP and NADPH are used to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into glucose, which provides energy for the plant's growth and development. The overall equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + light energy \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082.",

        "student_answer": "The heart is the main pump in the circulatory system. It has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. Blood without oxygen enters the right atrium, moves to the right ventricle, and goes to the lungs to get oxygen. Oxygen-rich blood comes back to the left atrium, moves to the left ventricle, and is pumped throughout the body. This helps transport oxygen and nutrients while also removing waste like carbon dioxide.",
        "model_answer": "The heart is the central organ in the circulatory system, responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. It consists of four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). Oxygen-poor blood from the body enters the right atrium, is pumped into the right ventricle, and then sent to the lungs for oxygenation. Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs enters the left atrium, moves into the left ventricle, and is pumped out through the aorta to the rest of the body. This continuous circulation allows for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissues and the removal of waste products, such as carbon dioxide, from the body. The heart's rhythmic contractions, regulated by electrical signals, maintain this vital process.",

        "student_answer": "Climate change is mainly caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities. These release gases like carbon dioxide into the air, which trap heat and cause the Earth to warm. The effects include rising sea levels, stronger storms, droughts, and changes to ecosystems. This also affects agriculture, human health, and economies.",
        "model_answer": "Climate change is primarily caused by human activities that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), methane (CH\u2084), and nitrous oxide (N\u2082O). These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a rise in global temperatures, a phenomenon known as global warming. Major contributors to climate change include the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes. The effects of climate change are widespread and include rising sea levels due to melting polar ice caps, more frequent and severe weather events (such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves), disruptions to ecosystems, and threats to biodiversity.

        "model_answer": "The theory of evolution by natural selection, first proposed by Charles Darwin, explains how species evolve and adapt over time through the differential survival and reproduction of organisms with advantageous traits. In any given environment, organisms exhibit variation in traits, such as size, color, or behavior. These traits are often inherited by offspring. Those with traits that better suit their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass these traits on to the next generation.
